# Laundry iOS App
iOS App designed to create a better laundry experience.

  This application, designed as an on-demand laundry pickup & drop-off application, was the primary product of Lavo Logistics Inc. ( where I led Developer Operations) until the company eventually folded, and it is now available for open-source use as it encompasses a lot of incredible functionality.

  This application goes end-to-end delivering an incredible laundry experience. The user can order their laundry to be picked up at any address or their current location, they can select their desired ordering options (wash, dry, folding, dry-clean, etc.), they can select their ordering preferences (if order is recurring, whether it is weekly, monthy, etc), and then they can place the order using one of many different payment options.

  From that point, the user is able to track their order progress on their screen step-by-step and eventually is able to review their service. 

  On the other end of things, the washing companies that have signed up for our service see this order come up on their system (conditional upon whether or not they fit the geographical-distance profile that we determine is most optimal. The washers then have full managerial capabilities throughout the pickup/delivery process such as managing, assigning and tracking the progress of specific employees and being able to go through their profit. business, and employee analytics to evaluate where their strengths and weaknesses as a company are coming from. 

  All of this is wrapped nicely into a clean, simple UI that uses many custom components to bring unique features to the application. Data is stored on a NoSQL Database (Firebase) and the payment-handling servers are written in Node.

NOTE:
  Lavo Logistics, and this project, were both led by Robert Epstein, an innovative, impressive, and brilliant individual that is currently a student at the esteemed University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. His incredible market research and ingenuity that he brought to the company were invaluable and he was a major reason that this project saw traction.
